# Overlake Path Planner

Overlake Path Planner is a browser-based tool for creating autonomous paths for FTC robots.
It runs fully offline from a release zip and can be opened by double-clicking `index.html`.

This tool is just the frontend webapp you can use to draw autonomous paths with actions. For the recommended code to run on your robot that will interface with this webapp, see https://github.com/OverlakeRobotics/OverlakeRoboticsLibrary. 

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release zip from the GitHub releases on the right
2. Extract it
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

Optional: Edit `config.js` (next to `index.html`) to customize defaults and tag templates.

## Features

### Path building
- Place points by clicking on the field
- Choose segment types: Line, Bezier, Arc, or Free draw
- Switch alliance (Red/Blue) or mirror the path with one click

### Fast upload
- Connect to your robot's wifi and upload paths instantly
- Real time pose updating to see the robot position on screen
- Requires code from https://github.com/OverlakeRobotics/OverlakeRoboticsLibrary to be on the robot for direct upload and pose updating

### Edit mode
- Select and drag points directly on the field
- Expand any point in the right panel to edit X, Y, and heading
- Reorder points by dragging them in the points list

### Tags
Tags are metadata on points that the robot can read (velocity changes, waits, launch artifacts, etc.)
- Add tags to any point from the right panel
- Tags are run once the robot reaches the point the tag is attached to
- You can edit the code in your robots OpMode to change what each tag does
- Tags use templates from `config.js`, including units and defaults

### Global variables
Global variables let you update many tag values from a single number.
- Create globals in the left panel
- Set a tag value to use a global variable
- Change the global and all linked tags update automatically

### Import / Export
- Export paths as JSON for sharing or later edits.
- Reimport JSON to restore points, tags, and global variables.
- Design an OpMode to run directly from the JSON or use code from https://github.com/OverlakeRobotics/OverlakeRoboticsLibrary

## Notes

- The app is designed to run offline from a local `index.html`.
- If you update `config.js`, refresh the page to load changes.
